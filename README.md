# Store Sales Prediction

This project aims to predict the weekly sales of stores for a chain using regression techniques. Based on historical data, we analyzed various factors influencing sales, including holidays, temperature, the price of goods, Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the unemployment rate. Several regression models were constructed and evaluated to determine the most efficient.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the weekly sales of stores using regression techniques. We analyzed historical data covering the sales of 45 stores from 2010 to 2012, considering factors such as holidays, temperature, CPI, and unemployment rate.

## Data Description
The dataset includes:
- Number of stores: 45
- Time period: 2010 to 2012
- Variables: sales, holidays, temperature, CPI, unemployment rate, etc.

## Data Exploration
Initial exploration of the dataset, including basic statistics and data structure.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In-depth analysis to understand the data, including visualization and identification of patterns.

## Data Pre-processing
Steps taken to clean and preprocess the data before modeling.

## Data Manipulation
Techniques applied to the data to make it suitable for modeling.

## Feature Selection/Extraction
Methods used to select or extract features that are most relevant for the predictive models.

## Predictive Modelling
Different regression models used, such as:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

## Evaluation
Evaluation metrics and the performance of the models, with tables or charts if necessary.

## Conclusion
Findings and conclusions from the project.

## Usage
Instructions on how to use the code, including steps to install necessary packages and run the scripts.

## Contributing
How others can contribute to the project.
